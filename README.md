[Live site link here!!!](https://infallible-khorana-72773f.netlify.app/)

Built with MUI and React. APIs include Google's SafeBrowser API to detect dangerous websites, Passwordinator built by fawazsullia to randomly generate secure passwords, and a Spam email verifier made by EVA. Was a helpful project to learn more about APIs in general. Thanks for visiting!
